Chapter 2
1. rails scaffold:
	rails generate scaffold User name:string email:string
2. migrate database:
	rails db:migrate
3. Create user by scaffold:
	rails generate scaffold User name:string email:string
	list pages for suser:
		/users index page to list all users
		/users/1 show page to show user with id 1
		/users/new new page to make a new user
		/users/1/edit edit page to edit user with id 1
4. restful routes provided by the user resources
	HTTP request URL Action Purpose
	GET /users index page to list all users
	GET /users/1 show page to show user with id 1
	GET /users/new new page to make a new user
	POST /users create create a new user
	GET /users/1/edit edit page to edit user with id 1
	PATCH /users/1 update update user with id 1
	DELETE /users/1 destroy delete user with id 1
5. By referring to Figure 2.11, write out the analogous steps for visiting the
URL /users/1/edit.
	-The browser issues a request for the /user/1/edit URL.
	-Rails routes /user/1/edit to the edit action in Users controler with user_id=1
	-the edit action call set_user method,set_user asks the the user model to retrive information of user 1
	-the user model pulls user 1 from database.
	-the User model returns user 1 to the controller
	-the controller captures the user has user_id=1 in the @user variable
	,which is passed to the view the view uses embedded ruby to render the page as html
	-the controller passes the html back to the browser.
6. Weaknesses of scaffold Users resource:
	-No data validation
	-No authentication
	-No tests
	-No style or layout
	-No real understanding
